When it comes to talking about myself, I am horrible. What I am even more horrible at doing though is blogging. One thing you can count on is that this blog will often be nothing more than ramblings. Sometimes those ramblings will include cat pictures (like this one)...Even if it has nothing to do with cats. Sometimes I will ramble about nerdy things. I hope to ramble about Chef things and share some lessons learned as I go through that journey. 

Really, if you couldn't tell, I have no idea what I'm going to actually blog about. But having a website makes me feel important, so instead of just reiterating what is already contained on LinkedIn, I thought I would add a blog.

Is it too late to mention this is a test post? Yeah...It's one of those too.
