I have officially registered for ChefConf!

One thing I am most excited for, other than seeing my ChefFriends, is the Monday workshop. Last year, I decided to take the workshop on Compliance as my exposure to that was very limited at the time. This year, things have changed..

A few weeks ago I was asked about my experience with writing custom Ohai plugins. Of course, at that time I knew little to nothing on this topic. Having never written a custom plugin, I was intrigued and began reading up on it.

Fast forward to last week.

I noticed it was time to register for ChefConf. As I began the registration process, I noticed a little gem on the workshop selection page. The workshop was entitled "Extending Cookbooks - Custom Resources & Ohai Plugins". Is Chef stalking me? Had they heard my innermost thoughts hoping for a workshop on specifically this topic? As you have probably guessed, I quickly signed up for this.

So, while I'm at ChefConf this year, I will be learning about Custom Resources and Ohai Plugins, and I could not be more excited.
