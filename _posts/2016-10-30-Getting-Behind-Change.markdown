Change is hard. That is a true enough statement for individuals right? What about organizations though? Do they find change as hard? The answer is yes. Whether the organization is big or small, everyone struggles with change. Why is it though that we find change so hard? Is it delving into uncharted territory that scares us, or is it something else entirely? From my experience, change can be made easier by remembering a few important things:

#### Individuals Deal with Change Differently.
Remembering that an organization is made up of many types individuals that handle situations differently is critical to the success of any project -- especially one that is going to change the way multiple teams work. It is important to keep all of those differences in mind when pivoting an organization.

#### Educate, Educate, Educate
Remember how I said individuals that make up an organization deal with change differently? I am of the belief that education is a way to combat that. People who do not understand the new processes that are also resistant to change are going to fall into an even worse pattern of that behavior if they feel left behind. Understanding that in order for those individuals to feel empowered you must put a significant emphasis on education and training on the new processes and/or technology is critical. Don't leave behind your most important people.

#### Involve Those Affected in the "Process"
Am I suggesting that all big organizational decisions involve everyone? Absolutely not. It is important though for those that will be in the "thick of it" to have an understanding of how exactly their team will be impacted. By involving them, it is possible to mitigate struggles you may hit in the future that would have otherwise been unforeseen. This will also give everyone a sense of ownership in the process. Wisdom of crowds and all that...

From what I have observed over my short career, these steps will help mitigate a resistance to change within an organization.
