Over the next several weeks I plan to start really deep diving into Docker. The goal is to give myself a better understanding of what Docker actually is and what it does, but also give me some ideas on what Docker _can_ do.

Now, several of these posts are going to be boring and informational, but when I'm out searching for information on something that I haven't been very exposed to typically I want someone to _break.it.down.for.me_. I'm a firm believer in not using complex technical jargon just for the sake of using it. These posts will be very much for me to wrap my head around concepts, but I hope they are useful for someone else too.

#### Links for posts in the series can be found below:
I will be adding links to both Learning Docker concept posts and any related tutorials.
