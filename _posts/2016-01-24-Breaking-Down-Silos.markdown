Silos are a problem in many organizations - both big and small. Understanding how to break down silos also requires an understanding in how silos happen in the first place.

Take for example this scenario:
Tom works for Awesome Inc. He's worked here in the same position for more than 6 years. On any given day, you can find Tom sitting at his desk making Awesome happen like he always does. When others on Tom's team are met with a challenge and they request help from the most knowledgable member of the team, Tom makes their lives easier and just completes the task for them.

#### What has Tom done wrong?
Tom, though well-meaning, has actually seriously harmed his team by his willingness to take on their work for them. In doing this, his team member has been "robbed" of the chance to learn the process so the next time they are faced with this challenge they will have to again go to Tom for help, and again have Tom do the work. Sharing knowledge with each other is critical to keeping silos from forming.

It is not just in small teams where silos can form though... Silos can form across an entire organization as well.

#### So what is the solution?
The solution for this is simple: breed a culture in your organization that embraces collaboration. No matter what you do, you will always have employees that have been around a while and know a little more about the ropes, but if you've bred a culture of collaboration knowledge sharing will always be taking place. No longer will employees feel the need keep key information to themselves in order to stay on top, but they will be empowered to teach their fellow team-mates everything they know which will in turn make everyones lives easier. Embracing this culture is critical to success in the new "DevOps" world.
