    <p><h3>ChefConf 2018 - Chicago, IL - May 22-25, 2018 - Session: Herding Cats: How to Get an Entire Organization Cooking With Chef</h3></p>
    <p>Abstract: We often hear technical talks about how companies are utilizing Chef to be awesome and successful, but we rarely get to hear about the human aspect of these transformations. Using Chef successfully requires a significant amount of emphasis to be placed on internal Chef practitioners and culture. Without these key ingredients, companies may find their road to success paved with pot holes and their perceived finely tuned processes falling to the wayside in favor of professional cat herding. In this talk, I plan to discuss how we built Chef User confidence internally as well as how we’re working to onboard an entire company with Chef. I will also discuss how we’re tackling the problem of the Chef Learning Curve (TM) and the inherent knowledge gap that comes along with it.</p>
