              </header>
              <p>Ohai friends! I'm Brittany. By day I am an automator of the things. Specifically, I work to provide automation solutions through utilization of Chef. I enjoy teaching others how to automate the things and be successful Chef practitioners. Additionally, I enjoy providing solutions to complex problems that many businesses face in their journey into automation. </br></br> Starting as a Technical Support Rep, I have grown into a role as a System Administrator and now hold the title of Automation Engineer. During a typical day you can find me assisting multiple teams with cookbook development, making processes better and less painful for the organization, and generally being awesome.</br></br> In my free time, I enjoy watching UK panel shows like Mock The Week, 8 Out of 10 Cats, and QI. I am also the proud parent of dogs and cats and enjoy turning them in to the most spoiled creatures in Central Missouri </br></br> Feel free to browse around. I am not always the fastest at updating my content, but I do hope to provide several tutorials in my "Tutorials" section. I will also be rambling about random things in my blog section. If you find something helpful, share with your friends if you would like. I hope that some of my learning experiences can be helpful to others.</p>
